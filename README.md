## Basic Details

### Team Name: [PHILOCALYS]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [DEVANANDA ANILKUMAR] - [VIDYA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MFTnpRWwIXV8iwhnc-33fvYglFtK9h1u/view?usp=sharing]

### Project Description
[This project is a Flask-based travel planning web app that helps users discover nearby tourist attractions using OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia APIs. It also estimates trip costs based on budget and number of days, and provides climate insights.]

### The Problem statement
[The problem this project solves is:

Travel planning can be overwhelming — it’s hard for users to know which attractions to visit, how much it will cost based on the number of days we planned.

This app solves that by:

Showing nearby tourist attractions automatically

Estimating costs based on your budget and trip duration

Providing climate info

In short, it makes trip planning easier, smarter, and more efficient.]

### The Solution
[Automated Attraction Discovery: It uses OpenStreetMap to get location coordinates and Wikipedia’s geosearch API to find nearby tourist spots.

Smart Cost Estimation: Based on user-input budget and number of days, it calculates approximate costs for food and activities, showing remaining budget.

Climate changes: Uses latitude and country info to suggest best months

Integrated Frontend: Presents all information in an interactive web interface with search, budget input, and visually organized results for easy planning]
